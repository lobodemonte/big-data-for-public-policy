To rerun this project 

If you need to get information about different congress sessions, rerun this:
1. Rerun 0_congress_gov_scraper.ipynb for your specific congressional sessions

If you need to refresh the funding data or the party counts (if you used different congress sessions)
2. Rerun 1_Data_Preparation.pynb

Notes: Congressional Density Index is managed here by CityLab: https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/tree/master/citylab-congress

Finally, after all data is up to date (to whatever date range you're using) we can follow the steps in this file:
3. Rerun 2_Data_Analysis.pynb

All data is contained within the final/data/ directory
